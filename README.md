## About Me
I'm a software engineering student exploring deep learning, mobile development, and hardware‑adjacent tooling. I enjoy building tools that make device testing repeatable and reliable, designing thoughtful user interfaces, and experimenting with machine learning models to solve real problems.

---

## 🔭 What I'm Working On
- 📱 React Native apps (Expo), cross‑platform mobile experiences with a focus on accessibility and performance  
- 🎮 DualSense controller testing suite,  Raspberry Pi + Electron + Node‑HID for hardware QA and diagnostics  
- 🛍 Django e‑commerce platform, wishlist, gamified features, and data‑driven UX optimizations  
- 🗂 Node.js API documentation generator, lightweight, customizable, Swagger‑like tool for internal APIs  
- 🧠 Learning: Transformers, PyTorch, model optimization, and MLOps basics
